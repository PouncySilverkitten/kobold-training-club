<p>Hello and welcome to Kobold Training Club!</p>
<p>You should find it fairly easy to use - filter the monsters on the table by using the different selectors on the
    left. You can search the results, and sort them by each column in the table.</p>
<p>Kobold Training Club also accepts sheets from Kobold Fight Club without needing any modification! Open the
    "Alignments" section to the left for more information.</p>
<p>Due to a bug during a recent database migration, you may need to re-add your custom sources. Please accept my
    apologies for the inconvenience and rest assured that I'm working hard to bring you a better product with every
    release!</p>
<p>Fixed in this version:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Preventing duplication when importing a sheet containing a monster which is already known</li>
    <li>Fixing a bug known to cause truncation of sources with a url rather than page number</li>
</ul>
<p>Up next: proper mobile layout!</p>
<p>Thanks again, and happy rolling!</p>
