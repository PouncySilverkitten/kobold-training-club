<p>Hello and welcome to Kobold Training Club!</p>
<p>You should find it fairly easy to use - filter the monsters on the table by using the different selectors on the
    left. You can search the results, and sort them by each column in the table.</p>
<p>Kobold Training Club also accepts sheets from Kobold Fight Club without needing any modification! Open the
    "Sources" section to the left for more information.</p>

<p>Version notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added 'smart' encounter generation, grouping monsters together in a way that makes narrative sense. Don't like it? Not to worry - a 'dumb', truly random encounter generator is comming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not going to be releasing an update in November, instead I'm focusing on cleaning up the codebase more, adding tests, and emphasising code cleanliness. Come December, I plan to start working on a series of front-end improvements.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and happy rolling!</p>
