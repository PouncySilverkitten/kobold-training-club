<p>Hello and welcome to Kobold Training Club!</p>
<p>You should find it fairly easy to use - filter the monsters on the table by using the different selectors on the
    left. You can search the results, and sort them by each column in the table.</p>
<p>Kobold Training Club also accepts sheets from Kobold Fight Club without needing any modification! Open the
    "Alignments" section to the left for more information.</p>
<p>Version notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Moved the Run in Improved Initiative to the top bar, and set it to open in a new tab</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, I'm working on cleaning up the codebase, and implementing random encounter generation. This one always
    struck me as a challenge, so I'm looking forwards to sinking my teeth into it.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and happy rolling!</p>
